tank_size = 15 #Total Tank Size of Vehicle
# Define the total distance covered
distance = 600 #Total Distance able to be traveled on Full Tank
# Calculate miles per gallon
mpg = distance / tank_size #Miles per Gallon Equation
# Print the result
print("Miles per gallon:", mpg) #Prints the Miles per Gallon expected
